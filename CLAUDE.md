## What this is

A ROS 2 **Jazzy** / Gazebo **Harmonic** workspace for autonomous navigation of an
Agilex Scout Mini (skid-steer, 4 wheels). The repo root *is* the colcon workspace;
everything lives under [src/](src/). Vendored dependencies are git submodules
(`scout_ros2`, `ugv_sdk`, `rslidar_sdk`, `ch10x-imu-driver`, `rudn-ordjo-building`
world/models, and a `scikit-fmm` fork under [depend/](depend/)) — clone with
`--recursive`, and treat submodule code as upstream unless a change is clearly
intended for it.

First-party code is in [src/agx_navigation/](src/agx_navigation/):

| package | role |
| --- | --- |
| `agx_bringup` | all launch files + config; the only place topology/params are wired |
| `agx_planning` | vector field, PMP planner, runtime corrector, RL corrector (Python) |
| `agx_chassis` | `twist_to_wheels`, `wheel_odometry` |
| `agx_planning_msgs` | `PlannerTrajectoryChunk` msg, `PlanToGoal` action |
| `pointcloud_utils`, `rviz_toggles` | C++ helpers / RViz plugin |

## Commands

Everything goes through the [Makefile](Makefile); it sources
`/opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash` + `install/setup.bash` for you. Prefer `make <target>`
over raw `colcon`/`ros2` so the env and launch params stay consistent.

```bash
make                      # == make build (deps + colcon build --base-paths src)
make clean                # rm -rf install build log .*.stamp
make setup                # one-time: install ROS 2 Jazzy, Gazebo, system deps
make deps                 # rosdep + pip install of the workspace python packages
make test                 # unit tests (pytest, no ROS needed)
make run SIM=true         # full stack in Gazebo;  SIM=false runs on the robot
make online / offline     # run with NAV_MODE=vec-pmp and the matching PMP_MODE
make nav2                 # run with the nav2 stack instead
make rviz / make teleop
```

`make build` is stamp-gated (`.build.stamp` vs. every file under `src/`), so a
touched file forces a rebuild; delete the stamp if a build seems stale.

Run a single test:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src/agx_navigation/agx_planning python3 -m pytest \
  src/agx_navigation/agx_planning/test/unit/test_rl_reward.py::test_name -v
```

Unit tests live in [src/agx_navigation/agx_planning/test/unit/](src/agx_navigation/agx_planning/test/unit/)
and cover the *pure* RL-corrector modules (`coeff`, `obs`, `reward`, `nominal`,
`env` via the kinematic bridge) — no ROS, no Gazebo, no torch import path.
Keeping those modules ROS-free is deliberate; don't add `rclpy` imports to them.

Make variables in `PARAM_VARS` (`SIM`, `HEADLESS`, `FLOOR_NUMBER`, `NAV_MODE`,
`PMP_MODE`, `USE_SERVER`, `DO_CORRECTIONS`, `PORT_NAME`) are lowercased and passed
straight through as launch arguments — adding a new launch arg usually means
adding its name there too.

## Architecture

### Runtime pipeline (vec-pmp mode)

```
SLAM/rtabmap map ─► vector_field ─► pmp_planner ─► runtime_corrector ─► JointGroupVelocityController
                    (FM2 field)     (PMP TPBVP)    (playback + residual)   (4 wheel velocities)
```

- **`vector_field`** ([vector_field/node.py](src/agx_navigation/agx_planning/agx_planning/vector_field/node.py)) —
  Fast Marching Square: EDT → speed profile → `skfmm.travel_time` → `-grad T`.
  Publishes the packed field on `/vector_field/planner_data`; the gradient
  magnitude doubles as a confidence signal (low ⇒ cut locus / near goal).
- **`pmp_planner`** ([pmp_planner/node.py](src/agx_navigation/agx_planning/agx_planning/pmp_planner/node.py)) —
  indirect optimal control (Pontryagin) on a **5D wheel-space skid-steer model**
  `x = (p_x, p_y, θ, w_l, w_r)`, control = per-wheel accelerations, solved as a
  TPBVP with `scipy.integrate.solve_bvp`. The long module docstring is the
  authoritative spec of the model and cost terms — read it before touching the
  dynamics or the cost weights. Two modes:
  - `online` — runs its own control loop, publishes wheel commands on
    `/pmp_planner/wheel_cmd`.
  - `offline` — a `PlanToGoal` action **server** that rolls out a whole trajectory
    and streams it back as chunked feedback.
- **`runtime_corrector`** ([runtime_corrector/node.py](src/agx_navigation/agx_planning/agx_planning/runtime_corrector/node.py)) —
  the only writer of `/wheel_velocity_controller/commands`. Mirrors the planner's
  mode (relay in `online`, action *client* + trajectory playback in `offline`, see
  `trajectory_buffer.py`). Everything funnels through `_emit() -> _correct()`,
  which is the seam where the RL residual applies. `JointGroupVelocityController`
  latches its last command, so **every terminal path must publish an explicit
  zero** — silence keeps the wheels spinning.

Left/right pair speeds expand to the controller's joint order
`[front_left, rear_left, front_right, rear_right] = [w_l, w_l, w_r, w_r]`.

### Launch topology

[main.launch.py](src/agx_navigation/agx_bringup/launch/main.launch.py) is the entry
point and composes: `gz_sim` (only when `sim:=true`) → `robot_control`
(scout_description + `sim_control` or `life_control` + EKF) → `slam` (delayed 10 s,
rtabmap) → `nav` which branches on `nav_mode` into `nav2.launch.py` or
`vec_pmp.launch.py`. Launch files resolve each other via
`agx_bringup.utils.launch_file` / `cfg_file`; topic names come from
`agx_bringup.constants.Topics` rather than string literals.

### RL runtime corrector

[rl_corrector/](src/agx_navigation/agx_planning/agx_planning/rl_corrector/) trains a
SAC residual policy that scales per-wheel feed-forward commands to hold the frozen
planner trajectory under slip. Key invariants:

- **`config.py` (`RLCorrectorConfig`) is the single source of truth** shared by
  training and deployment. The `use_*` toggles define the observation *layout*,
  which is baked into the network's input width — they are build-time choices, not
  runtime switches. A policy must be deployed with the exact toggles (and
  `coeff_k`) it trained with, and they must stay fixed across curriculum phases.
- Reward and tracking error use Gazebo **ground-truth** pose, never `/odom` —
  wheel odometry cannot observe slip, which is the whole phenomenon being corrected.
  The IMU is the slip-observing input in the observation.
- The env talks to a **`Bridge`** ([bridge.py](src/agx_navigation/agx_planning/agx_planning/rl_corrector/bridge.py)),
  never to Gazebo directly: `KinematicBridge` (fast, Gazebo-free, used by tests and
  `make p0`) or `GazeboBridge` (real physics, needs `make rl-sim` up).
- Kinematics constants in `RLCorrectorConfig` intentionally duplicate
  `pmp_planner/config.py` (to avoid pulling scipy/skfmm into the pure modules) —
  **keep them in sync manually**.
- With `rl_corrector.policy_path` unset (the default) the corrector is a
  byte-identical identity pass-through; that's the fail-safe.

Training (see [README.md](README.md) for full detail):

```bash
make rl-deps                          # stable-baselines3[extra] + torch + gymnasium
make rl-sim HEADLESS=true             # terminal 1: minimal sim (no nav/planner/corrector)
make rl-train TIMESTEPS=200000        # terminal 2
make p0 | p1 | p2 | p3 | curriculum   # phased curriculum, chained with --load
make rl-kill                          # ALWAYS run this after a Ctrl-C'd/orphaned run
```

Only **one** sim at a time — two instances share Gazebo's default transport
partition and both advertise `set_pose`/`pose/info`, so resets silently break.

`make rl-deps` is *not* the only thing that installs torch, despite the name:
`agx_planning/setup.py` lists `torch` and `stable-baselines3` in `install_requires`,
so plain `make deps` already drags in the whole CUDA wheel stack (~3-4 GB of
`nvidia_*` wheels). Budget for that on a fresh machine or a slow link; `make
rl-deps` afterwards is nearly a no-op. Move torch to an extra if a robot/laptop
install ever needs to avoid it.

`make rl-sim` already runs **without the rendering sensors** — `SIM_SENSORS`
defaults to `false`, dropping the GPU lidar and RGB/depth cameras, since the
trainer consumes only ground-truth pose, the `/odom` twist and the IMU. A slow
realtime factor during training is physics, not rendering; don't go looking for
sensor overhead to trim. (`make run` is the one that pays for sensors + SLAM.)

## Remote GPU training server

Training can run on a Proxmox VM (`danya02-gmatiukhin-ros2-gazebo`, VM 200) with a
Tesla V100 passed through. The [Justfile](Justfile) holds the remote workflow —
new commands go there rather than in the Makefile, which stays the source of truth
for building and running; the recipes only drive `make` over ssh.

```bash
just sync / remote-build      # rsync the working tree up, build there
just remote-sim               # headless sim in tmux (only ever one)
just remote-train p1          # a phase in its own tmux window, TB=runs
just remote-log sim|train     # attach read-only
just tb                       # TensorBoard tunnelled to localhost:6006
just fetch-policies           # pull ~/rl_corrector_p*.zip back
```

Non-obvious facts about that box, all of which cost time to work out:

- **`packages.osrfoundation.org` is throttled to ~6 KB/s** from the VM (other
  mirrors run at ~800 KB/s), so `apt install gz-harmonic` stalls indefinitely.
  Workaround: `apt-get install --print-uris`, fetch the osrfoundation `.deb`s from
  a machine with a working route, drop them in `/var/cache/apt/archives/`, re-run
  the install. PyPI is *not* affected.
- **GPU passthrough (`hostpci0`) pins all guest RAM**, so virtio ballooning cannot
  return memory and the guest gets stuck at the `balloon:` floor while the host
  reserves the full `memory:`. Set `balloon: 0` for any passthrough VM — it costs
  the host nothing, since the pages are pinned regardless.
- **A Tesla V100 has no display engine.** The usual headless `ConnectedMonitor
  "DP-0"` xorg.conf cannot work — modes validate to `NULL` and you get a 640x480
  stub screen, which is why Sunshine reported "no display connected" and failed
  *every* encoder including software. The fix is a virtual framebuffer (`vga:
  virtio` on the VM) plus VirtualGL to route OpenGL to the V100.
- Cores beyond ~4 don't help: training is a single env stepping one Gazebo
  instance, and `TORCH_THREADS` is deliberately 1. Parallel envs would need
  per-instance `GZ_PARTITION`/`ROS_DOMAIN_ID` plumbing that does not exist yet.

## Conventions

- Non-obvious design decisions are documented in long module docstrings (the PMP
  planner, the runtime corrector, `RLCorrectorConfig`). When changing behaviour
  there, update the docstring in the same edit — they are treated as the spec.
- Node parameters are loaded from dataclasses via
  `agx_planning.utils.declare_and_load_dataclass`; add a field to the dataclass
  rather than a bare `declare_parameter`.
- `acados/` at the repo root is untracked scratch; the Makefile's `ACADOS_*` /
  `t_renderer` bits are vestigial and unset by default.
